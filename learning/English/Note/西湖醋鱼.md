“西湖醋鱼”是浙江杭州传统风味名菜,它的得名源于一个悲戚而感人的故事。
相传古有宋姓兄弟,常年在西湖打鱼为生。当地恶棍赵大官人有一次游湖,路遇一浣纱女,见其美姿动人,就想霸占。派人打听,原乃宋兄之妻，遂施阴谋,害死宋兄。恶势力的侵害,使宋家叔嫂非常激愤,两人上官府告状,企求伸张正气,使恶棍受惩。哪知官府是同恶势力一个鼻孔出气的，不但没受理控诉，反而一顿棒打,把他们赶出官府。回家后,宋嫂要宋弟赶快收拾行装外逃,以免恶棍跟踪报复。临行前,嫂嫂烧了一碗鱼,加糖加醋,烧法奇特。弟问嫂嫂:怎么烧得这个样子?嫂嫂说:有甜有酸,是想让你外出后,切莫忘记你哥是怎么死的,你的生活若甜,勿忘老百姓受欺凌的辛酸之外,别忘你嫂饮恨的辛酸。弟听了很是激动,吃了鱼,牢记嫂嫂的心意而去。
后来,宋弟得了功名回到杭州,报了杀兄之仇,把那个恶棍惩办了。可宋嫂一直查找不到。有一次,宋弟出去赴宴,吃到一道菜,味道就是他离家时嫂嫂烧的那样,连忙追问是谁烧的,才知道正是他嫂嫂的杰作。
原来,从他走后,嫂嫂为了避免恶棍来纠缠,隐姓埋名,躲入官家做厨工。宋弟找到了嫂嫂很是高兴,就辞了官职,把嫂嫂接回了家,重新过起捕鱼为生的生活。

"West Lake Fish in Vinegar Gravy" is a renowned dish in Zhe cuisine of traditional flavor in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. Its name originates from a sad and touching story.

According to the legend, there had been two brothers whose family name is Song, earning a living by fishing by the side of West Lake for many years. One day, the notorious local blackguard, Load Zhao, was taking a boat ride on the lake and came across a girl washing clothes. Seeing her beautiful figure, he wanted to take her for himself. He sent someone to find out who she was, and discovered that she was the wife of Song's elder brother. He then organised a conspiracy, murdered him, and abducted his wife. Angry at the victimization by the evil, Song's younger brother and his sister-in-low went to the feudal official to seek justice and punishment for the thug. However, the official, in cahoots with the blackguard, not only threw out the case, but also beat them up and evicted them from the court. After returning home, the elder Song's wife told her husband's younger brother to pack his bags and flee immediately, as she feared that the gang would track him down for revenge. Before leaving, she cooked a fish, adding sugar and vinegar, cooking in a unique way. He asked her, "Why did you cook it this way?" She replied, "With sugar and vinegar, I want you to remember the poignancy of those people being oppressed and don't forget the bitterness of my resentment when your life is sweet." Deeply touched, the younger Song ate up the fish and left, bearing his sister-in-law's words in mind.

Later, the younger Song, getting an official rank through passing the imperial examinations, returned to Hangzhou to take revenge on the blackguard who had killed his elder brother. However, after punishing the thug, Song's sister-in-law was still nowhere to be found. One day, Song's younger brother attended a banquet where there was a dish that tasted exactly like the one his sister-in-law had cooked just before he left home. Immediately asking who was the chef, he magically found that it was cooked by his sister-in-law indeed.

It turned out that after he left, his sister-in-law had changed her name and went into hiding as a cook in an official's household in a bid to avoid being bothered by the blackguard. Exhilarated to find his sister-in-law, Song's younger brother resigned from his job and brought her back home, resuming their life of living on fishing.
