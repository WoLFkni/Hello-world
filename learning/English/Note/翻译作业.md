"Three passions, simply but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and the unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind." Bertrand Russell's essay, like a melody, strikes a deep chord in our hearts every time we read it with gusto. Russell is not alone in saying so. Passion, as I see it, figures strongly in our life in that it enables us to face difficulties briefly, to pursue a worthwhile life relentlessly, and to remain stubbornly curious about the untried territories. 
First, with passion, we can conquer difficulties against all odds, especially in adversity. Life is a journey bristling with ups and downs. We may feel elated in prosperity, and despond in adversity. It is in hard times that the power of passion can be strongly felt. Without passion, we may flinch from the setbacks that we're plagued with. They look so formidable and so heinous that they weigh unbearable heavily in our hearts. With passion, it will paint a different picture for us. A prime example is the patients who were diagnosed with fatal diseases.They might see passion, the passion to survive, as a strong impetus to fight against the giant monsters. It was with such strong bursts of passion that they finally recovered from the illness and broke away from the firm grips of impending death. 
Second, with passion, we can lead a fulfilling life with a strong determination. To a pessimist, a verdant grassland in the sunlight may be a place for weeping and pouring our miseries, while to an optimist, a bare mountain does not look bleak and desolate but presents a charming picture: an inexplicable beauty that is beyond the world's description. A college freshman may feel bewildered and doubtful when beset with academic challenges. If he is vulnerable to them, he will most likely feel frustrated and remain stagnant. However, if he's an enterprising one, he will brush them aside by applying himself to study. It is with such a passion for a full life that acquires knowledge with enthusiasm and takes much delight in the accumulation of wisdom. With the passage of time this passionate student will surely gain a bumper harvest at college.
Third, with passion, we can keep a curious heart about the unknown and untried territories. Without passion, medical scientists would not have gone to great lengths to find a cure for a seemingly incurable disease. Passion, like sparks, ignites their avid curiosity for the cure, an uncharted territory for them to relentlessly explore. No one knows how many experiments they might have conducted and how many sleepless nights experienced before they saw the medicine finally roll off the production line. Without a strong passion, their curiosity would be stifled and the determination to lick the enigmatic medical problems nowhere to be found.
In conclusion, only with passion can we deal with setbacks in our life, strive to live a rewarding life, and remain inquisitive about the new world. I am confident that if thrown a question at a well-accomplished celebrity, be a scientist, an entrepreneur, or an artist, he or she will certainly reward us with a reply:" Without passion, there can be no genuine achievement." This remark, I believe, is where our dream is taking off.

“三种激情，简单而又无比强烈，主导了我的一生：对爱的渴望，对知识的追求，以及对人类苦难的难以忍受的同情。” 伯特兰·罗素的这篇文章，就像一首旋律，每次我们充满热情地阅读时，都会深深地触动我们的心灵。罗素并不是唯一这样说的人。在我看来，激情在我们的生活中扮演着重要角色，因为它能让我们短暂地战胜困难，不懈地追求有意义的生活，并对未尝试过的领域保持顽固的好奇心。
首先，有了激情，我们可以在逆境中战胜一切困难，尤其是在逆境中。生活是一段充满起起伏伏的旅程。在顺境中，我们可能会感到欣喜，而在逆境中，我们可能会感到沮丧。正是在艰难时刻，激情的力量才能得到强烈感受。没有激情，我们可能会对困扰我们的挫折退缩。它们看起来如此强大和可怕，以至于在我们心中留下难以承受的沉重负担。有了激情，它将为我们描绘出一幅不同的画面。一个典型的例子是被诊断出患有绝症的患者。他们可能会把激情，生存的激情，看作是与巨型怪物作斗争的强大动力。他们怀着如此强烈的激情，终于战胜了疾病，摆脱了即将死亡的束缚。
其次，有了激情，我们就能以坚定的决心过上充实的生活。对于悲观主义者来说，阳光下的绿草地可能是一个哭泣和倾诉痛苦的地方，而对于乐观主义者来说，光秃秃的山并不显得荒凉和贫瘠，而是呈现出一种迷人的景象：一种无法用语言描述的神秘美。一个大一新生可能会在学术挑战面前感到迷茫和怀疑。如果他无法克服这些挑战，他很可能会感到沮丧，停滞不前。然而，如果他是一个有进取心的人，他会通过努力学习来克服这些挑战。正是这种对充实生活的热情，让他充满热情地获取知识，并从积累智慧中获得极大的乐趣。随着时间的推移，这个充满激情的学生一定会在大学里收获丰硕的成果。
第三，有了激情，我们就能对未知和未尝试的领域保持好奇心。如果没有激情，医学科学家就不会不遗余力地寻找一种看似无法治愈的疾病的治疗方法。激情就像火花，点燃了他们对治愈方法的强烈好奇心，这是他们不懈探索的未知领域。没有人知道他们在看到药物最终下生产线之前可能进行了多少次实验，经历了多少个不眠之夜。如果没有强烈的激情，他们的好奇心就会被压抑，征服神秘的医学难题的决心将无从谈起。
总之，只有激情才能让我们应对生活中的挫折，努力过上充实的生活，对新世界保持好奇。我相信，如果向一位成就斐然的名人提出一个问题，无论是科学家、企业家还是艺术家，他或她肯定会给我们一个回答：“没有激情，就不会有真正的成就。”我认为，这句话就是我们的梦想开始的地方。
