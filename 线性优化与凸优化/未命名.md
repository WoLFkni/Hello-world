compute the differential of functions $g(r,\theta,\psi) = (rsin\theta cos\psi,rsin\theta sin\psi,rcos\theta)^T$ and $h(x,y,z)=(\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2},arccos{\frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}},arctan\frac{y}{x})^T$ 
what is the relation between g and h, and what is the relation between $Dh$ and $Dg$?
(Hint: you can use I for *identity matrix*, note that, there is no commutative law for matrix multiplication)
