Show that $f_n = (\phi^n-\psi^n)/\sqrt{5}$, where $\phi,\psi$ are the positive and negative roots of $\lambda^2 = \lambda+1$. Deduce that $f_n = \{\phi^n/\sqrt{5}\}$,where {x} denotes the integer closest to x.Hence obtain the approximate upper bound $log_\phi(a\sqrt5)-2=4.785log_{10}(a)-0.328$ for the number of steps required to compute $gcd(a,b)$ by Euclid's algorithm, where $a\ge b > 0$ .


The line ax+by=c cuts the x- and y-axes at c/a and c/b, so its length in the first quadrant ($x,y\ge0$) is $c$$\sqrt{a^{-2}+b^{-2}}$. By Theorem 1.13, successive integer points (x,y) on this line have x- and y- coordinates differing by b and a, so they are distance $\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\ge c\sqrt{a^{-2}+b^{-2}}$, that is, $c\ge \sqrt{(a^2+b^2)/()}$
