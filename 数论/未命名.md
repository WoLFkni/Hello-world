Show that $f_n = (\phi^n-\psi^n)/\sqrt{5}$, where $\phi,\psi$ are the positive and negative roots of $\lambda^2 = \lambda+1$. Deduce that $f_n = \{\phi^n/\sqrt{5}\}$,where {x} denotes the integer closest to x.Hence obtain the approximate upper bound $log_\phi(a\sqrt5)-2=4.785log_{10}(a)-0.328$ for the number of steps required to compute $gcd(a,b)$ by Euclid's algorithm, where $a\ge b > 0$ .
